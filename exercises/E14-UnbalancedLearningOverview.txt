In a problem of majority-minority classification, the class imbalance in the data sets can dramatically bias the performance of the classifiers, introducing a prediction bias for the majority class. Assuming that the positive (minority) class is the interest group and the given application domain determines that a false negative is much more expensive than a false positive, a negative (majoritarian) class prediction bias could have adverse consequences. With big data, mitigating class imbalance poses an even greater challenge due to the varied and complex structure of relatively much larger data sets. This document provides a broad survey of studies published in the last 8 years, focusing on high-class imbalance (ie, a majority-to-minority class ratio between 100: 1 and 10,000: 1) on large data to assess the state vanguard in the treatment of adverse effects due to class imbalance. In this document, two techniques are covered that include DataLevel methods (for example, data sampling) and Algorithm-Level (for example, cost-sensitive and hybrid / set). Data sampling methods are popular for addressing class imbalance, and random sampling methods generally show better overall results. At the algorithm level, there are some outstanding artists. However, in the published studies, there are inconsistent and contradictory results, along with a limited scope in the evaluated techniques, indicating the need for more complete comparative studies.
